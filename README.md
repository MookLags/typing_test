# Terminal Typing Test

I've always liked typing tests. I used to use the [Live Chat](https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/) typing test until I found [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). What a great website.

Sometimes I don't have internet and still want to mess around on Monkeytype. I figured it wouldn't be too hard to build my own, and I thought it would be a fun challenge to do it in the terminal. 

I used a virtual environment (python3 -m venv ... ) and I put all the dependencies in a requirements.txt which just has ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```. I've never done this before so hopefully it works if you'd like to download it and mess around. I plan on including an executable file of the most recently updated and functional version of it included in the repo available for download.

It's no Monkeytype... but it's fun : - )
